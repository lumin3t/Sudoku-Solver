## Sudoku Solver

A simple web-based sudoku solver made using HTML, CSS, Javascript. It used backtracking algorithm to solve a 9x9 sudoku puzzle.

### Notes
I addressed the issues causing the site to crash with invalid input and other errors. Now, error handling makes sure the site remains functional.
